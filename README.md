This repository provides contains Dockerfiles for working with EnergyPlus in R
via [eplusr](cran.r-project.org/package=eplusr) package, based on
[rocker/rstudio:latest](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/rstudio) container.

## Quickstart

    docker run --rm -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=yourpasswordhere hongyuanjia/eplusr

Users can include the version tag of EnergyPlus, e.g.
`hongyuanjia/eplusr:9.1.0`, and use the default `latest` tag, e.g.
`hongyuanjia/eplusr` for the most up-to-date EnergyPlus. Currrently, the lowest
supported version is `v8.3.0`.

Visit <http://localhost:8787> in your browser and log in with username `rstudio` and
the password you set. **NB: Setting a password is now REQUIRED.** Container
will error otherwise.

## Common configuration options:

### Install a different version of EnergyPlus

Sometime you may want to install another version of EnergyPlus along side with
current EnergyPlus you are specified. There are two ways to do so:

* If you want
  EnergyPlus to be installed into the default location using
  [eplusr::install_eplus()](https://hongyuanjia.github.io/eplusr/reference/install_eplus.html),
  you have to give the root permissions when you run the container by passing
  `ROOT=TRUE`:

    docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -e ROOT=TRUE -e PASSWORD=yourpasswordhere hongyuanjia/eplusr

* If you do not want to give the root permission, an alternative way is to
  download the version of EnergyPlus you want using `eplusr::download_eplus()`
  and manually install it following the
  [instructions](https://energyplus.net/installation-linux).

### Bypassing the authentication step

**Warning: use only in a secure environment**. Do not use this approach on an
AWS or other cloud machine with a publicly accessible IP address.

Simply set the environmental variable `DISABLE_AUTH=true`, e.g.

```
docker run --rm \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8787:8787 \
  -e DISABLE_AUTH=true \
  hongyuanjia/eplusr
```

Navigate to <http://localhost:8787> and you should be logged into RStudio as
the `rstudio` user without needing a password.
