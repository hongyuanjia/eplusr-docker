This repository provides Dockerfiles for working with EnergyPlus in R
via [eplusr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=eplusr) package, based on
[rocker/rstudio:4.1.0](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/rstudio) and
[rocker/verse:4.1.0](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/verse) container.

## Supported EnergyPlus versions

All releasees starting from `v8.3.0` are supported. Users can include the
version tag of EnergyPlus, e.g.  `hongyuanjia/eplusr:9.1.0`, or use the default
`latest` tag, e.g. `hongyuanjia/eplusr` for the most up-to-date EnergyPlus.

The default upstream container is
[rocker/rstudio:latest](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/rstudio). But you can
add a suffix `-verse` to get a
[rocker/verse:latest](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/verse) based container,
e.g. `hongyuanjia/eplusr:9.1.0-verse`, `hongyuanjia/eplusr:latest-verse`.

## Quickstart

```
docker run --rm -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=yourpasswordhere hongyuanjia/eplusr
```

Visit <http://localhost:8787> in your browser and log in with username `rstudio` and
the password you set. **NB: Setting a password is now REQUIRED.** Container
will error otherwise.

## Common configuration options:

### Install a different version of EnergyPlus

Sometime you may want to install another version of EnergyPlus along side with
current EnergyPlus you are specified. There are two ways to do so:

* If you want
  EnergyPlus to be installed into the default location using
  [`eplusr::install_eplus()`](https://hongyuanjia.github.io/eplusr/reference/install_eplus.html),
  you have to give the root permissions when you run the container by passing
  `ROOT=TRUE`:

  ```
  docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -e ROOT=TRUE -e PASSWORD=yourpasswordhere hongyuanjia/eplusr
  ```

* If you do not want to give the root permission, an alternative way is to
  download the version of EnergyPlus you want using
  [`eplusr::download_eplus()`](https://hongyuanjia.github.io/eplusr/reference/install_eplus.html)
  and manually install it following the
  [instructions](https://energyplus.net/installation-linux).

### Bypassing the authentication step

**Warning: use only in a secure environment**. Do not use this approach on an
AWS or other cloud machine with a publicly accessible IP address.

Simply set the environmental variable `DISABLE_AUTH=true`, e.g.

```
docker run --rm -p 8787:8787 -e DISABLE_AUTH=true hongyuanjia/eplusr
```

Navigate to <http://localhost:8787> and you should be logged into RStudio as
the `rstudio` user without needing a password.
